8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,490
PROFESSOR: So I will go into a
little about what the class

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,790
is, and what you're
going to do.

10
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,100
I'll just put one slide about
requirements and outcomes.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,190
So what are the requirements?

12
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,550
We require you to be a good
programmer with a lot of

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,390
programming experience.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,180
As I said, we are going down
to very bare metal.

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,980
And there won't be any
niceties of just

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,850
writing Java code.

17
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,140
So you're going to run into a
lot of these kind of issues.

18
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,260
Fluent in C is --

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:53,430
I wouldn't call it a 100%
requirement, but it really

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,770
helps if you're fluent in C.
If not, you'll have to

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,510
probably spend a lot of time
trying to understand C, C++.

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:05,230
And in this class that means --
just start doing it today,

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,080
just get a C book and then
try to understand.

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,640
If you run a lot of Java it
might be an easy transition.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,070
But get to the transition
fast, don't wait.

26
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,140
What are we expecting
at the end?

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,920
We expect at the end
for you to know --

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,880
AUDIENCE: I have to go.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,716
Thank you very much
[INAUDIBLE]

30
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,790
PROFESSOR: So what
do we expect?

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,290
We expect at the end you'll
probably understand a lot of

32
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,410
fundamentals and concepts of
parallel programming --

33
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,260
both hardware and software.

34
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,230
Because the nice
thing about --

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,770
or the nice thing or the
bad thing about Cell --

36
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,710
is a lot of hardware conceptuals
to expose.

37
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,340
There's no nice abstraction
layers in there.

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,280
You'll understand a lot of
issues about parallel

39
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,060
performance.

40
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,220
We started here, you write a
program, compile -- it's not

41
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,570
just order n you're
looking for.

42
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,970
You're looking for all
these constants.

43
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,290
All these things matter,
basically.

44
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,100
You should be able to synthesize
a fairly complex

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,020
parallel program by the end,
because that's what your group

46
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,260
project's going to be.

47
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,060
And you'll get a lot of hands-on
experience with the

48
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,930
Cell processor, so we'll
understand this one

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,350
instance very well.

50
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,820
So that is what we are expecting
will happen at the

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,390
end of this 3.5 weeks.

52
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,360
So the project.

53
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,750
You proposed the projects, we
did something different.

54
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,230
So it's all your ideas that
we are going to do.

55
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,710
We selected seven groups out
of these -- there are seven

56
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,000
projects in there --

57
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,300
mainly based on the strength
of the project proposals.

58
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,330
And I was pretty impressed with
the height of things you

59
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,030
guys proposed.

60
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,660
So here are the seven
projects.

61
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,480
Let's actually try to figure
out who's who.

62
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Who's doing distributed
real-time ray tracer?

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,110
OK, that's not true.

64
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,510
OK, how about the global
illumination?

65
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,060
OK.

66
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,490
Linear algebra pack?

67
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,990
OK, good.

68
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,600
Molecular dynamics?

69
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,030
OK.

70
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,890
Speech synthesizer?

71
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,950
OK.

72
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,480
Soft radio?

73
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,600
OK.

74
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,550
Backgammon tutor?

75
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,050
OK.

76
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,660
And there are some people who
are, I think, in this class

77
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,260
thinking that they
can join a group.

78
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,420
So at the end, there are a few
groups that only have one

79
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,190
member, so probably go ahead
and talk to them and see

80
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,240
whether they are willing
to work with people.

81
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,720
So I'll give you a little bit of
time, because I'm going to

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,970
finish early.

83
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,570
OK, let's ask -- who are
the people who are

84
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,380
hoping to join a group?

85
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,240
Is there anybody who came?

86
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,660
I got a few emails, I don't
know that anybody's here.

87
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,900
Oh good.

88
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
So it's not going
to be a problem.

89
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,020
So I did the project
characteristics.

90
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,860
You can see that they are
ambitious projects, but

91
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,310
accomplishable.

92
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,990
I was worried that people would
say, "I'm going to build

93
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,460
this entire thing", and it's
going to take a year.

94
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,500
But I think most of the projects
that they proposed

95
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,260
are doable.

96
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,020
Another thing is important
and relevant things.

97
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,410
I think for a lot of these
things, if the code is done

98
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,960
right other people might
even use it.

99
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,160
I think this can start
something, it's not just going

100
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,600
to be this project.

101
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,710
And there's a lot of opportunity
to sizzle.

102
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,710
I think some people will come
up with these things that I

103
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,100
think at the end will
be so amazing.

104
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,880
And that's what got
me excited.

105
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,310
But get them started as soon as
possible, because this is

106
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,800
not a semester course, this is
going to run so fast. There's

107
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,440
only a few all nighters
you can pull,

108
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,850
basically is what it is.

109
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,610
So there's a note of caution.

110
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,230
Cell processor is very new.

111
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,350
We heard about that today.

112
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,940
I mean this is a really
cool thing, but it has

113
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,850
its problems in there.

114
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,530
It's not an easy architecture
to work with.

115
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,960
There is though this
nice abstraction.

116
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,510
So it's just then from this
being completely abstracted

117
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,570
out, writing Java code, to
all the way to metal.

118
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,560
So it's just almost a jump
from going to a higher

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,790
language of assembly.

120
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,990
So there's a huge, big gap in
there, and that's going to be

121
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,810
a lot of issues in there.

122
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,270
The tool chain is very
thin and brittle.

123
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,870
So my pointing out all those
things, you wish there's a

124
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,720
tool, but there's nothing.

125
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,510
And even the existing tools --

126
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,715
we just got the SDK 2.0 into
working I think this morning

127
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:03,800
-- and so there might
be issues in there.

128
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,980
Most of the staff have
limited experience.

129
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,380
For example, SDK 2.0.

130
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,110
We just got it working, so we
haven't used it yet in there.

131
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,835
So that can create problems,
especially in

132
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:17,480
a fast moving course.

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,580
The projects you are doing
are of your own making.

134
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,920
Most of the classes --

135
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,000
if you need to [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,040
classes, we actually come up
with the projects, TAs go and

137
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,420
implement it once, we know
all the gotchas.

138
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,070
And then when you get the
project we know there's an

139
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,230
existence proof that
it's doable, it

140
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,840
works, the tools work.

141
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,470
We know at least there's
one path through it.

142
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,950
There's nothing like
that here.

143
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,500
Everybody's kind of just jumping
at it head on, and

144
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,170
hoping that we can read them.

145
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,670
And we might find issues that
are very hard, and that's why

146
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,230
we actually have very
close contact with

147
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,150
those guys at IBM.

148
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:53,330
So if things happen, we'll call
them and they will be

149
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,680
available to help us.

150
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,730
But it's not something you can
say -- oh yeah, I know, just

151
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,380
go do that.

152
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,050
Or -- here's the way out.

153
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,900
So there might be issues like
that, so we have to be very

154
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,020
careful of that.

155
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,540
And you will face these kinds of
problems. That's more given

156
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,960
than anything else, so
be ready for that.

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,390
This is not just writing some
high level code and getting

158
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,540
away with it.

159
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,250
And you're all in
this together.

160
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,120
So the staff, you,
me, everybody --

161
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,170
we're just doing it for the
first time in some sense.

162
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,840
And that's the fun part about
it, because as you pointed

163
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,040
out, there might be some stuff
that you guys come out with

164
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,060
that will become more like
folklore and the basis for the

165
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,330
things people do.

166
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,690
Because you might say --
hey, there's a neat

167
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,470
way of doing that.

168
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,220
You will be the first to
do this kind of thing.

169
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,460
So there's that time, but on
planning the three week course

170
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,550
it's a large chunk to bite.

171
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,030
If it is more for a PhD,
then you can say --

172
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,430
OK, spend three months
figuring it out.

173
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,830
There's no other time limit.

174
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:51,406
So we will try to manage this
process, but you need to try

175
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,780
to -- expectations of what you
are trying to get done, and

176
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,980
then be able to get it done.

177
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,570
So you have to always
balance this out.

178
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,120
If you're running into issues,
get to us very fast. Because

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,150
we need to figure it out.

180
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,250
And we might have to actually
also figure it out from

181
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,590
somebody else, so we can
escalate it up and get the

182
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,110
information.

183
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,500
Because three weeks are
going to go so fast.

184
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,850
How many people are taking
the class for a grade?

185
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,935
So people who are taking it for
a grade, here is what we

186
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,750
are going to do.

187
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,540
The first thing, what I call
mini quizzes, is just a prop

188
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,260
so you will come into class.

189
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,860
So the way I am going to do that
is, at the beginning of

190
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,360
the class I am going to give you
a piece of paper with two

191
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,510
questions from the
previous lecture.

192
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,020
You can do anything you
want to answer it.

193
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,510
You can talk to people,
look it up, whatever.

194
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,660
And then at the end
of the class

195
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,630
basically we want it back.

196
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,110
And the only requirement is, you
have to come individually

197
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,290
to pick your thing up, and you
have to come individually to

198
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,310
hand it in, and you can't write
somebody else's anwers

199
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,910
physically, but you can
talk to each other.

200
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,232
So we'll try to make it a little
bit entertaining, and a

201
00:07:55,232 --> 00:07:58,270
little bit thought-provoking,
but nothing like you have to

202
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,520
spend hours doing it.

203
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,390
It'll be probably
five minutes.

204
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,670
Normally we will do a break
inbetween, so you probably can

205
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:09,310
talk to each other and come up
with some of the answers.

206
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,110
So this is just the fact that
the people who are actually

207
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,270
getting the grades will be
coming to class, more than

208
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,680
anything else I'll be testing.

209
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,320
And then we have these lab
projects at the beginning,

210
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,280
that will get some grade.

211
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,330
And the final group project.

212
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,800
And then we have a final
competition.

213
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,405
So since everybody's not doing
the same project, we are going

214
00:08:30,405 --> 00:08:32,720
to decide on performance --

215
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:39,400
so how well your code ran, how
much MIPS or [? GOPs ?] you

216
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,710
were able to get from that.

217
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,380
And how raw performance
is in there.

218
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,440
And then we will also
look at it from a

219
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,430
complexity point of view.

220
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,900
So for example, as I pointed
out, if you do matrix

221
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,630
multiplier you get certain
performance, so if you do

222
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,710
[? FF3, ?] you get certain
performance.

223
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,460
So just absolute numbers is not
what matters, but how far

224
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,920
you can get hard
algorithm too.

225
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,390
Completeness.

226
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,100
So were you able to get
your project through?

227
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,170
How much do you actually have a
compete solution at the end

228
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,210
that something works?

229
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,300
That's important.

230
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,150
Algorithmic complexity -- how
much of a complexity did you

231
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:17,810
bite in, both from more of a
pure algorithm point of view,

232
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,070
and also implementing some
shared complexity in there.

233
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,860
And demo and presentation.

234
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,250
So OK, those two.

235
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,740
So we are going to select
a winning team.

236
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,960
We haven't figured exactly what,
but we'll give everybody

237
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,400
a gift set depending on --

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,250
this is what we are aiming
at right now.

239
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:39,550
Also we are going to invite the
winning team to spend a

240
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,910
day at IBM TJ Watson.

241
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,470
You get to give a presentation
to a bunch of people there,

242
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,020
and probably go see what
they are doing.

243
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,840
That should be a fun
day to spend.

244
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,810
We haven't scheduled a day,
depending on the class

245
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,580
schedule and stuff like that,
the winning team will go spend

246
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,160
a day out in there.

247
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,920
That will be a fun thing to
do, there's a lot of cool

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,140
stuff going on there.

249
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,670
They will get to actually
interact with some

250
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,090
researchers, see what they
do, as well as present

251
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,180
this work to them.

252
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,230
And since this is new
everybody's excited.

253
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:11,620
I think hopefully we'll come
up with a team that will do

254
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,460
things that other people will be
interested in and will use.

255
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,590
So these kind of come from
backward because I wanted to

256
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:23,790
get Mike Perrone first.
So my name is Saman --

257
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:24,510
Saman Amarasinghe --

258
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,950
I live in CSAIL.

259
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,510
I have had a lot of
interest in --

260
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,550
[LAUGHTER]

261
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,780
Not as much as you
guys probably.

262
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,820
I have a lot of interest in
languages, compilers, and

263
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,000
computer architecture.

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,350
So if you have been at this game
for a long time, in the

265
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,200
early 1990s there was a huge
surge in parallel performance,

266
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,630
work on parallelism, and at
that time I did the SUIF

267
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,140
parallelizing compiler
in there.

268
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,120
And then, everybody says -- hey,
there's this Moore slope

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,420
of performance, who cares
about parallelism?

270
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,890
So there was this decade
when this paralellism

271
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,900
kind of died down.

272
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,460
I kind of hid under the radar
and kind of survived through

273
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,810
that thing, and then again I
think parallelism coming up.

274
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,280
So we are doing a bunch of
parallel work in here.

275
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,860
So I probably have a perspective
that goes

276
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,820
somewhere old, and
then coming up.

277
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,570
Probably Aaron can also
relate to that.

278
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,440
Aaron: There's one of
us who did that.

279
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,210
PROFESSOR: Yeah exactly.

280
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,080
Going through that, kind
of survived in that.

281
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,430
And Rodric is sitting there.

282
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:29,310
So Rodric is right now at IBM
PJ Watson, but he's probably

283
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,400
going to live at CSAIL next
month, so he's going to be

284
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,290
here more than me in fact.

285
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,320
He was actually in the lab until
a few months ago, as a

286
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,160
research scientist. He's also
interested in a lot of these

287
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,680
kinds of things -- compilers,
architecture, parallel

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,890
architecture, and
FPGA type work.

289
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,000
And then we have two TAs.

290
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,340
Where's David and Phil?

291
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,790
OK, get up.

292
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:57,020
So they actually have
some experience.

293
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,910
Probably they are about a week
ahead of you on understanding

294
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,300
Cell, not too much.

295
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,910
They are going to lead the
recitations and be available

296
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,160
to help you in there.

297
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,610
So really use those resources
as much as possible.

298
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,980
And then we are going to have
a huge amount of guest

299
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,740
lecturers, and I was pretty
happy with the

300
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,840
kind of list we got.

301
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,270
Mike Perrone just came and gave
you the lecture, and Alan

302
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,780
is going to talk
in a few weeks.

303
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:29,440
And Professor Arvind, Brad
Kuszmaul, Mike Acton -- that

304
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,400
Mike Perrone talk about is
going to come at the end.

305
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:36,760
And Bill Thies, who was one
of the PhD students in the

306
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,990
Streamit group, is going
to talk about

307
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,310
the Streamit language.

308
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:45,350
So the way we have kind of
structured the class is, how

309
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,090
do you go about extracting
parallelism.

310
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,490
There's implicit parallelism.

311
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,260
And sometimes the
current way of

312
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,340
everything done by hardware.

313
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,370
In the next lecture, I will just
touch upon superscalar

314
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,690
hardware, what it is and
what its problems are.

315
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,700
Implicit parallelism means
you can do by compiler.

316
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,150
So you write a C program, and
let the compiler deal with the

317
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,620
parallelism.

318
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,035
For as long as you are a
programmer, you don't have to

319
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:16,050
deal with that thing.

320
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:18,230
In lectures 11 and 12
I will talk about

321
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,440
parallelizing compilers.

322
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,890
So we'll cover how you can
do that [? in C. ?]

323
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,020
So that means kind of abstract
it out, and leaving it out of

324
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,450
the end programmer.

325
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,430
So the hardware exposes it, but
we put a software layer.

326
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,420
And then the other end is
explicit parallelism.

327
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,830
That's where, I think, we are
going to spend most of the

328
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,550
time in this class.

329
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,830
So in the first part of explicit
parallelism is the

330
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,170
library approach.

331
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,410
What that means is you are using
MPI type things, so you

332
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,270
are basically at the metal
dealing with this parallelism.

333
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,830
I am going to do lecture
4 on concurrency.

334
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,540
How many people took 6.170 last
year when I was teaching?

335
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,880
OK.

336
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,310
I did a lecture on concurrency
there, so something very

337
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:05,020
similar I'm going to do in here
-- to get the basics of

338
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,660
parallelism.

339
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,320
In order to write a parallel
program, the program has to

340
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,090
run concurrently.

341
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,750
There's a lot of issues for
writing concurrent programs.

342
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,110
It is necessary to get parallel,
it's not sufficient.

343
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,470
There are a lot more other
things to worry about.

344
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,590
But let's deal with those
kind of issues --

345
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,520
deal with things like
synchronization, deadlocks,

346
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,600
and issues like that.

347
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,140
So I'm going to give that, and
then Rodric is going to have a

348
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,910
few lecture on design
patterns.

349
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:32,930
So if you want to write a
parallel program, how do you

350
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:32,980
look at it?

351
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,710
Different algorithms will
have different ways of

352
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:36,580
parallelizing.

353
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,330
So he's going to go about
looking at these kind of

354
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,200
parallel patterns.

355
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,956
If you have this kind of
program, here is a

356
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:42,660
way to look at it.

357
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,770
Here's another way
to look at it.

358
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:47,880
So kind of go through
that in there.

359
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,250
And in concurrency we work
with a lot more abstract

360
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:56,130
parallel model, and get slowly
down to all the realism needed

361
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:58,520
in dealing with Cell.

362
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,860
And then we are going to have
a bunch of guest lectures,

363
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,320
mainly dealing with other ways
of doing parallelism.

364
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,810
So this is one way.

365
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,850
We are going to have a lecture
on Streamit, because you might

366
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,220
be able to use that also
as a way on Cell.

367
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,330
So a little bit of high
abstraction, we are trying to

368
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,480
make that available on Cell.

369
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,250
So if that comes to, then you
might be able to even have

370
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,630
that as a part of your
toolbox in there.

371
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,220
The other three talks are
about very different

372
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,560
approaches for parallelism.

373
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,606
I think they will give you a
big picture view, it's not

374
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:32,090
that you're just going
through one

375
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,040
parallelling down in there.

376
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,400
I think at the end of to the day
you'll understand not only

377
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,370
how to deal with Cell, but
kind of a general way of

378
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,020
looking at parallelism, and
maybe from that approach

379
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,580
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] parallelism
in there.

380
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,970
So the lectures are organized
as follows.

381
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,440
We are now at the end
of the day here.

382
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,590
Tomorrow we'll have
a recitation on

383
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,120
getting to know Cell.

384
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,450
We are trying to figure out a
good room, so just check your

385
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,060
email to figure out exactly
where we are going to have it,

386
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,580
because we are trying
to figure it out.

387
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,930
We want to find a room with
machines so everybody can

388
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,295
actualy get hands-on experience
in kind of a

389
00:16:04,295 --> 00:16:05,000
lecture format.

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,720
And then we will have the
architecture, just general

391
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,730
parallel architecture, and an
introduction to concurrent

392
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,470
programming.

393
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,260
And then Rodric is going to
have individual meets with

394
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,770
individual groups,
trying to get the

395
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,190
groups' projects going.

396
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,330
So at that point kind of figure
out how we are doing

397
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,270
it, have some early ideas about
it so you can start

398
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:31,840
thinking and start the process
of doing that.

399
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,910
You can start working on Cell
probably from tomorrow, but

400
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,040
really get a day to kind of
get familiarized, and then

401
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,410
here start the project.

402
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,210
And then we will have
some lectures on

403
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,240
design patterns in here.

404
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,370
And as we go we'll have more
hands-on experience also.

405
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,460
Then we'll have a lecture
on Streamit.

406
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:03,210
So if you are using Streamit for
a part of the run program,

407
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,870
you'll be able to understand
what's going on.

408
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,380
And we'll get to some debugging
tools, hopefully we

409
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,320
will have to deal with these
things before that, but here's

410
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,240
something that if you're really
stuck, to get a breadth

411
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,790
of tools available in here.

412
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,430
And then we'll talk in general
about debugging and

413
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,360
performance monitoring and
performance optimization.

414
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,400
So at this point hopefully you
have done the first cart, you

415
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,560
have figured out what problems,
and start optimizing

416
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,530
things in here.

417
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:32,440
And then we'll going into a
little bit more breadth,

418
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,080
things like traffic paralleizing
compilers that I

419
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,330
talk about, getting implicit
parallelism in here.

420
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,290
And then we will have a bunch of
guest lecturers coming in.

421
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,680
And we'll talk about some
hardware and the future,

422
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,690
because we are just starting
this very new phase in

423
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,130
programming that might change
almost everybody.

424
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,490
Five years, ten years down the
line if you go through

425
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,250
computer science, you might have
a very different flavor,

426
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,990
if what people think of
parallelism takes hold.

427
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,800
So let's look at some future,
and talk about that.

428
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,910
And it's a nice way to
finish the lectures.

429
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,600
A few more days and then
we'll have group

430
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,920
presentations in here.

431
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,890
So each group will get about
15 minutes time to present

432
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,130
what they have done and give
a little bit of a demo.

433
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,710
And then finally on
Friday we will

434
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,200
have awards and reception.

435
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,470
So this is what we got.

436
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,720
Any questions?

437
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,090
AUDIENCE: For recitations, if
we're not in a room with

438
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,570
machines should we
bring laptops?

439
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,910
PROFESSOR: So that's
a good question.

440
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,815
Who doesn't have a laptop
they can bring?

441
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:47,290
OK.

442
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,820
If that is the case, we can have
it in any room we want,

443
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,970
and have the network.

444
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:54,380
And we might have one or two
additional machines for people

445
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,710
who don't have a laptop.

446
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,230
And that actually will work
much better than everybody

447
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,580
marching into some kind of a
computer room that's not

448
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,410
structured properly
for doing a class.

449
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,160
OK, that actually helps a lot.

450
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,980
That's a good point, I think
that helps a lot.

451
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,024
OK, we'll do that
that way then.

452
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,510
AUDIENCE: How do we get access
to these machines?

453
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,330
PROFESSOR: OK.

454
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:14,830
Rodric, you --

455
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:23,010
RODRIC RABBAH: Every room has
a PS3 dedicated to them.

456
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:26,060
And every group has accounts
on their dedicated PS3.

457
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,020
I have your usernames
and passwords.

458
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,200
I will pass them out tomorrow,
because I'm going to propagate

459
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
the new SDK to all the PS3's --
to sort of test it with one

460
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,890
and make sure everything's
working.

461
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,350
So you'll get them at the first
recitation tomorrow.

462
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:42,440
Unless you really want them
today, then come talk to me or

463
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,355
send me email.

464
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:44,420
PROFESSOR: You'll get
to take home --

465
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

466
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:46,360
PROFESSOR: Yes.

467
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,240
RODRIC RABBAH: Yes.

468
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,360
PROFESSOR: We couldn't even put
it in the machine room,

469
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,365
because they were scared
somebody was going

470
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,200
to take them home.

471
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,310
So we actually have it in a
different room -- closed,

472
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:55,590
nicely locked --

473
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,010
or on the network.

474
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:00,475
So I have been a very popular
person lately, a lot of people

475
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,740
have tried to bribe me
to get access to

476
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,990
one of these masters.

477
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:08,468
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

478
00:20:19,283 --> 00:20:22,570
AUDIENCE: How much does
the PS3 cost?

479
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:29,016
PROFESSOR: Officially $600, but
then eBay's going up to

480
00:20:29,016 --> 00:20:30,710
like $2,500 these days.

481
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,880
AUDIENCE: No.

482
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,530
PROFESSOR: That's gone down?

483
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,360
AUDIENCE: They're down between
$400 and $500.

484
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,020
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

485
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,933
AUDIENCE: They tried
[? to rope me in. ?]

486
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,350
[LAUGHTER]

487
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,240
PROFESSOR: OK.

488
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,260
But during Christmas
it was down for --

489
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,118
a few desperate payers who
were trying to bribe me.

490
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,280
[LAUGHTER]

491
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,690
So I guess their volume
has caught up to --

492
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,320
AUDIENCE: No, the demand
has dropped.

493
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,630
PROFESSOR: OK.

494
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

495
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,850
AUDIENCE: Will we get to
see the Playstation?

496
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,610
PROFESSOR: Tomorrow we
can bring one --

497
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,120
AUDIENCE: I can bring
one [INAUDIBLE]

498
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,980
PROFESSOR: If you put
a game in it's fun.

499
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,540
You can put a game in and play
it, but this is going to be

500
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,920
Linux so it's a little
bit boring.

501
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,652
[LAUGHTER]

502
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:22,115
AUDIENCE: So these are
things that actually

503
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,090
cannot play the games.

504
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,730
PROFESSOR: It can.

505
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,730
Interestingly, mostly these
game machines are sold for

506
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,450
less than production value.

507
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,350
So Microsoft, Nintendo, and
Sony before made sure that

508
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:41,090
nobody can run anything other
than the published games that

509
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,680
they've charged $25 per pop to

510
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,520
recover the cost. Huh?

511
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,620
No, $60 for the game.

512
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,660
I think they are charging $25
from the game maker just for

513
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,040
the privilege of running
the game.

514
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,140
That's how they make
their money.

515
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,070
But, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

516
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,370
when they made PS3 bootable
by Linux.

517
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:04,200
So in fact, it's much cheaper,
you get a Blu-Ray player, and

518
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,529
this Cell processor for a lot
less than the production cost.

519
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,819
AUDIENCE: Does Linux on
the PS3 run on top

520
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,601
of the PS3 OS though?

521
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,290
PROFESSOR: No.

522
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,720
It just boots up PS3.

523
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
What it does is in fact --

524
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,130
right now, you don't get
access to the graphics

525
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,240
processor properly.

526
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,570
So you can run open G11.

527
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,120
You have framebuffer access,
but you don't get the full

528
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,410
graphics access out of that.

529
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,530
AUDIENCE: Which distribution
are we using?

530
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:30,900
PROFESSOR: Which one?

531
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,342
AUDIENCE: We're using
Yellow Dog.

532
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:38,770
AUDIENCE: So in other words,
Mario and Luigi are

533
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,416
subsidizing what we're
going to do.

534
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:41,360
[LAUGHTER]

535
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,430
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

536
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,830
All those shoot them up games
are basically what subsidizes.

537
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:51,280
Actually he said, in one sense,
you get the processor

538
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,610
down to $200 because they are
selling all the other things.

539
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,010
And the other thing, actually
if you want to build a high

540
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,680
performance Cell farm, it's
probably cheaper because I

541
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,210
think that the Cell blend
would be $2,000.

542
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,480
It should be cheaper to
buy a bunch of PS3's,

543
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,400
connect them together.

544
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,520
But there might be issues about
things like network

545
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,160
access, file access, because as
you pointed out, the board

546
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,880
access is pretty primitive.

547
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,510
Because for games you don't
need this high bandwidth

548
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,200
connection, you just need
to download it once.

549
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,860
So there might be issues
using it for cluster.

550
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,670
OK.

551
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,920
Anything else?

552
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
OK, good.

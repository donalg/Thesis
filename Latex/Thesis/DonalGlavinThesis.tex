\section{Introduction}

% Introduce the general purpose:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Understanding temperature distributions in Engineering applications plays an invaluable role toward understanding the effectiveness of design. 
As the most frequently measured physical quantity, the quantification of temperate values and their distributions allows for design goals to be achieved in a far more succinct manner and plays a key role in a diverse range of engineering systems. One particularly challenging engineering process that proves problematic in obtaining thermal data for is the particle curtain. \\

% Define particle curtains and Potential uses: 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Particle curtains are defined as a stream of particles falling a fixed distance through a gas or fluid phase \mycite{AfsharCurtainPhd}. They are very common in industrial drying, particularly in the minerals and food industry \mycite{AfsharCurtainPhd}.


\begin{comment}
Particle curtains are defined as a continuous stream of particles made to fall in a curtain-like
shape through a gaseous medium. They are employed in a wide variety of industries as heat
exchangers for particulate mediums, due primarily to their simplicity and low operational costs \ts{\cite{AfsharCurtainPhd, AndrewLeePhd}}. Examples include the flighted rotary dryer (FRD) and the hopper, which are common in mineral and pharmaceutical industries. However, particle curtains are steadily emerging in promising new renewable energy technologies for use in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants. These solar particle receiver designs are currently in the early demonstration phase, delivering improved thermal efficiency through their direct storage of heat within sand-like particles \ts{\cite{christian2015system, viebahn2011potential}}.
